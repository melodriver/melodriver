- 👋 Hi, I’m @melodriver
- 📍 Based in Manchester, U.K
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack web development, AWS, and VR/AR. I particularly enjoy tech consultancy roles.
-  I previously worked as a client-facing Junior Engineer for the IN4.0 Group. I secured my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification in 2020, and gained free access to SANS Foundations via the U.K government in 2021.
- 🌱 2022 Update - I’m currently a UX Researcher, in addition to working on a freelance web development project for the Centre for Tendering, and progressing through CS50x.
- 🚀 I’m looking to build more projects and expand my visible GitHub portfolio.

I have gained £6k+ for us via university pitching and grants, and maintain and update the website single-handedly. We run via AWS and Wordpress and are Cyber Essentials certified as of Jan 2022.
